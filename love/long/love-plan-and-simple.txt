Love. Plain And Simple

I get butterflies,
every time,
You look at me, touch me, talk to me.
Big cheesy smiles across my face,
You fill that empty place,
Deep in my heart,
Where it has been lonely for such a long while,
I hope we never part.
Because if we did...
I don't know if I could take it..
I'm giving you my heart..
Please don't break it.
Oh I feel for you so much,
When your not with me
Oh how I miss your touch.
I go crazy waiting for your reply,
When I can't talk to you I want to cry.
I don't think I've ever felt this way..
Feelings for you come more and more each and every day,
You know how to make me smile
I hate being away from you
Even for a little while
You're so sweet
When I'm near you, my whole body fills with heat,
And I have an out of control heart beat.
I can't control myself
I can't help but want you all to myself.
I can't think of enough words to explain,
My feelings for you are simple, they're plain.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
I'm so glad we found each other
I'm so glad we love one another.
There are only so many words to use to say
You are more then okay
You're mine babe
